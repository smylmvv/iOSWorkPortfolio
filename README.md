## Strydal
Strydal transforms your enthusiasm for teaching into a successful online enterprise. It empowers coaches to develop courses and memberships, upload video content, and manage live sessions. The iOS application enables users to enroll in courses, participate in live classes, view on-demand videos, engage in discussions with instructors, and more. 

The live conference room was developed utilizing the Twilio SDK, which includes key functionalities such as one-on-one interactions, one-to-many communication, community mode, and a live video player controlled by the instructor. Additionally, it supports Airplay/HDMI and Bluetooth headphones. I served as the only mobile developer for the application.

##### 🔨Technologies: SwiftUI, MVVM + Clean Architecture, UI + Unit Tests, CI, Twilio SDK, StreamChat API, Push Notifications, AWS SDK, REST API (GraphQL on an early MVP).

## Buoywatch
Buoywatch is an application designed for iOS and Apple Watch, developed using SwiftUI and Combine. Since the launch of the latest Apple frameworks at WWDC, I have been experimenting with these technologies. This app provides real-time data from marine buoys, enabling users to quickly assess surf conditions. Frequently, swells do not arrive as forecasted; by monitoring buoy data, users can ascertain whether the swell has indeed reached the area.

##### 🔨Technologies: SwiftUI, Combine, MVVM, Bitrise, Notifications, No third party libraries.
##### 🚀Platform: 📱iOS, ⌚️watchOS

## Bus Dich Weg
Bus Far Away (Bus Dich Weg in German) enables users to link their devices to an internal Wi-Fi network provided on tourist buses. Once connected to the Wi-Fi system, users can begin listening to the commentary from the tour guide. A significant challenge involved researching, testing, compiling, and calibrating an audio library compatible with RTSP for iOS, ensuring minimal latency. Additionally, we needed to emulate the streaming device using a Raspberry Pi, as we lacked access to the customer's bus equipment.
